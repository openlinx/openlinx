## Set up

You need [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). It installs the Python version from `.python-version` and the locked dependencies:

```
uv sync
```

## Checks

Run every gate in CI's order. The script stops at the first failure:

```
uv run scripts/check.py
```

Each gate on its own:

| Gate | Command |
|---|---|
| Lint | `uv run ruff check .` |
| Format | `uv run ruff format --check .` (`uv run ruff format .` fixes it) |
| Types | `uv run mypy` |
| Tests and coverage | `uv run pytest` |
| Specs | `openspec validate --all --strict` |

- **One test file:** add `--no-cov`, for example `uv run pytest tests/cli/test_version.py --no-cov`. The 90% coverage gate is meant for the whole suite, and a partial run can fall below it.
- **Specs:** `openspec` is a Node tool. If it is not on `PATH`, the check script skips this step with a notice, and CI still runs it. Turn off its telemetry first: `export OPENSPEC_TELEMETRY=0` in bash, `$env:OPENSPEC_TELEMETRY = "0"` in PowerShell. The check script sets it by itself.

## Code style

- Write a comment only for a non-obvious *why*. Don't add a docstring to a function or method whose name and types already say what it does, and don't add a comment that restates the code.
- Each module starts with a one-line docstring that names the design decision it implements, such as "design D7 of 000-scaffold-project".
